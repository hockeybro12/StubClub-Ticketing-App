# StubClub-Ticketing-App

In today's ticket market, ticket prices start out really high when compared to face value long before an event, and drop continuously until they are below face value once the event has just started. This means that some people are making a loss and can't sell their tickets. Our app solves this problem since users can request tickets to events. A seller can then go and satisfy the request which means that the ticket will be sold to the person who requested it no matter what. This way a consumer can get the ticket at the price they want and the seller can make sure their ticket is sold as best possible market value. The seller is not guaranteed a sale on Stubhub, but is guaranteed one on our app.

Our app allows users to request for tickets for sold-out event at a certain price range. As the event comes closer, people with tickets can sell their tickets to these users at the requested price.

On the flip side, people with tickets can also advertise their tickets if want to sell it. People looking to buy tickets can buy these tickets.

# How to use:

Please not that this app was designed at a hackathon and only for iPhone 6 and iPhone 6s devices. Please use that device or use those on the simulator when running this project.

There are 3 sections. Tickets shows tickets that are being sold and requests shows requests that have been posted. To buy a ticket or fulfill a request, press on the row of the table view which will expand it. Then click "Buy Now" and say yes, and your request will be fulfilled. Add a new request by clicking the compose icon in the top right and fulfilling the required files. Also, choose selling or requesting by clicking the button. 

The app also features a watch interface. To use this, go to the logout tab. Click "Update watch" and the watch app will be updated with a table view. This will show all the tickets that the current user is selling. This can be expanded in the future to show bids on tickets and intelligence rating the price. This would be seen when clicking on the table view cell.
