# StubClub-Ticketing-App

In today's ticket market, ticket prices start out really high when compared to face value long before an event, and drop continuously until they are below face value once the event has just started. This means that some people are making a loss and can't sell their tickets. Our app solves this problem since users can request tickets to events. A seller can then go and satisfy the request which means that the ticket will be sold to the person who requested it no matter what. This way a consumer can get the ticket at the price they want and the seller can make sure their ticket is sold as best possible market value.

Our app allows users to request for tickets for sold-out event at a certain price range. As the event comes closer, people with tickets can sell their tickets to these users at the requested price.

On the flip side, people with tickets can also advertise their tickets if want to sell it. People looking to buy tickets can buy these tickets.
